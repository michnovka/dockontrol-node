# DOCKontrol node

This is code for peripheral Raspberry Pi with relay that works together with https://github.com/michnovka/dockontrol

## Requirements

PHP 7.3+

## Hardware

I use Raspberry Pi4 together with https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RPi_Relay_Board_(B) relay board. Commands are sent using Relay.sh script (must be added to sudoers file since it requires root privileges)
